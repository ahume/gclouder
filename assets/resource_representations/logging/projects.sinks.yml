enum(version_format): Optional. The log entry format to use for this sink's exported
  log entries. The v2 format is used by default. The v1 format is deprecated and should
  be used only as part of a migration effort to v2. See Migration to the v2 API.
string: Output only. An IAM identity—a service account or group—under which Stackdriver
  Logging writes the exported log entries to the sink's destination. This field is
  set by sinks.create and sinks.update, based on the setting of uniqueWriterIdentity
  in those methods.Until you grant this identity write-access to the destination,
  log entry exports from this sink will fail. For more information, see Granting access
  for a resource. Consult the destination service's documentation to determine the
  appropriate IAM roles to assign to the identity.
string (timestamp format): 'Optional. The time at which this sink will stop exporting
  log entries. Log entries are exported only if their timestamp is earlier than the
  end time. If this field is not supplied, there is no end time. If both a start time
  and an end time are provided, then the end time must be later than the start time.A
  timestamp in RFC3339 UTC "Zulu" format, accurate to nanoseconds. Example: "2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z".'
